                        <p>If you’re reading this article at work, chances are you spend a lot of time in an open office. And even though we may be seated farther apart these days, a lot of the noises you hear don’t seem to stay distant enough. Which means you’re probably feeling like you can’t accomplish anything until Mikey gets off that loud sales call. Or until Amy and Chris stop giggling over that TV programme they’re both binge-watching. Or until a half-dozen other distractions stop distracting you.</p>
                        <p>While the upsides of open-plan offices are clear – collaboration, camaraderie, energy and, if you’re lucky, some natural light from that window far across the room – the downsides are clear too. In a 2018 study in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, researchers found that employees in open-plan offices were bothered by noise, including the conversations of their coworkers. This, in turn, led to an increase in worker stress and a decrease in their ability to collaborate. So if you feel like you’re avoiding Mikey, Amy and Chris at work, you probably are.</p>

But you can choose how to work within it. The key to getting your work done is staying in a state of flow, especially by minimising interruptions while you move from task to task. Here’s how Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 with Bluetooth can help you do just that.</p></div></div>

             <div class="start-by-putting-main">
                <div class="start-by-putting-sub">
                    <div class="start-by-putting-img-text">
                        <div class="start-by-putting-img"> <img src="start-by-putting  image.jpeg" alt="" class="by-putting-img"></div>
                        <div class="start-by-putting-text"><p class="start-by-putting-text-p">Start by putting them on first thing in the morning – wearing headphones signals that you’re trying to concentrate. Playing a favourite playlist can minimise the distractions of your noisy surroundings too (when you really need to focus, try familiar music with no vocals). Whatever you’re listening to, the active equalisation technology of Headphones 700 makes for a rich, immersive experience. Meanwhile, the headphones’ noise cancelling technology works so well in open-plan offices because it detects the noise surrounding you and emits an opposing electronic signal that effectively “cancels” it. </p>   
                                                            <p class="start-by-putting-text-p">Some interruptions are unavoidable, however. Like when your boss comes by to ask for your opinion. Or, better yet, when a coworker swings by to ask for your coffee order. Instead of that awkward, hurried fumble to remove your headphones, just switch to Conversation Mode. With a simple swipe of a finger across your earcup, you can discreetly switch from full noise cancellation to full transparency. This pauses your audio content and drops the noise cancelling level down to zero. As a result, you can hear the outside world as clearly as if you weren’t wearing headphones at all.</p>  
                                                                <p class="start-by-putting-text-p">While Bose headphones are renowned for making your music sound great, Headphones 700 make your voice sound great too. (Your speaking voice, that is. When it comes to singing, you’re on your own.) When you need to make a phone call, microphones embedded in the earcups isolate your voice from office background noise – like Amy and Chris’s laughter – so the person you’re talking with will hear you loud and clear, and not them.</p>
                                                              <p class="start-by-putting-text-p">If you’re really serious about your conversations, consider Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 UC. They’re designed to help you work better, wherever you need to work (and these days, who isn’t working in unconventional ways?). Bundled with the Bose USB Link Bluetooth module, this special version of Headphones 700 delivers a convenient, pre-paired wireless experience for conference calls. Together, the headphones and module are Microsoft Teams-certified. They also work with Google Meet and are compatible with Zoom. So you can conduct meetings and collaborate with confidence.</p>

                <div class="start-by-putting-sub-2"><div class="best-of-all"><p>Best of all, Headphones 700 are just one of the noise cancelling options we have. Bose offers a variety of in-ear options as well, including our true wireless QuietComfort® Earbuds II . Once you have the right noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones, you can go back to liking your co-workers, your job and maybe even your open office.</p> </div>   </div>
